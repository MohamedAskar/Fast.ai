# Fast.ai

## Introduction <br/>

For those who doesn't know **[Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)**, It's an AI library built on top of **PyTorch** and it really changed the game. With a few lines of code you can build a running Machine Learning model that can produce a high accuracy.

## Prerequestes <br/>
You first need to install `pytorch` framework using `pip install torch` and then you need to install Fast.ai library using `pip install fastai` and you are ready to go.

## Imports <br/>

You only need to import these two classes <br/>
`from fastai.vision import *
from fastai.metrics import *`


## Notebooks

### 1. Binary Classification <br/>

Fast.ai took binary classification problems into a whole new level with **Transfer Learning** using a pretrained model we can build a binary classifier with a few amount of data and produce a very decent results
